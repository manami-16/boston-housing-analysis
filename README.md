### Abstract
Real estate investment is a core component of personal assets. Making effective and correct real estate investment choices can increase the confidence of individual investors and ensure the stability of their personal assets. The aim of this project is to explore the individual housing prices in Boston, Massachusetts, USA from 1980 to 2010, and provide suggestions for individual housing transactions. To achieve this goal, this project collects 26 independent variables including median selling price, MSI, and the ratio of sale price to original price in the Boston area from 1980 to 2010. We then use Regression, tree, and ANN models to explore the influencing factors of individual real estate investment and provide feasible real estate investment transaction suggestions. According to our results, exponential regression models outperform linear and polynomial regression models and tree models in indicating the influencing features of housing market, and ANN shows potential for predicting median prices. Finally, return on investment in short-term investment is computed from the predicted prices.
